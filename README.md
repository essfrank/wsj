Simple Bash script to download the Wall Street Journal for free (Mac Only)

To run this:
	1. Place the "getPaper" file on your Mac Desktop (easiest) or anywhere else convenient for you. 
	2. To give the script permission to execute, you might need to run $ chmod 755 <yourPath>/getPaper
	3. Double-click the executable file (or run it in terminal, no parameters needed) and follow the instructions.

Enjoy!
